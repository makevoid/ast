# Ast
### Awesome STyles

We couldn't name it ASS (Awesome Style Sheets), so it's AST, .ast!

### Ast is CSS rethinked

Is this center positioning?

    margin: 0 auto

no, this is center positioning.

    +centered


let's try with another one:

    +move_top(2px)

is better than:

    position: relative
    top: 2px

and more!

it also has some good defaults:

- minimal reset (see ast.sass, reset section)
